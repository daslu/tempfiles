# tempfiles

This is a small Clojure library for managing temporary files.

It allows to create a temporary files with a given extension (e.g., ".csv"), and get not only its path, but a suggested standard URL where it can be served relatively to a webserver.

By adopting this suggested URL, various tools such as Notespace can agree with various libraries such as Viz.clj on where temporary files should be placed.

For example, Viz.clj will create a temporary file with some data to be passed for visualization, Notespace will serve it on its webserver, and Viz.clj will create a Vega specification which knows what URL to use for reading the file.
